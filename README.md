 - Make front-end code quicker to write — loading Vue in one line, mustache templates, built-in <b>directives</b>, and re-usable <strong>components</strong> make Vue easy to read and easy to write
 
 
 - Make front-end code easier to modify and fix — using readable mustache templates, using built-in heavily-tested <b>directives</b>, and consolidating repetitive 
 code into <strong>components</strong> make Vue code less error-prone and easier to fix when errors do occur
 
 
 - Make front-end apps fast and responsive — Vue’s use of a <strong>Virtual DOM</strong> makes site updates happen only when they need to and incredibly fast when they do
