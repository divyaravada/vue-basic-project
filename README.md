 - Make front-end code quicker to write — loading Vue in one line, mustache templates, built-in directives, and re-usable components make Vue easy to read 
 and easy to write
 
 
 - Make front-end code easier to modify and fix — using readable mustache templates, using built-in heavily-tested directives, and consolidating repetitive 
 code into components make Vue code less error-prone and easier to fix when errors do occur
 
 
 - Make front-end apps fast and responsive — Vue’s use of a Virtual DOM makes site updates happen only when they need to and incredibly fast when they do
